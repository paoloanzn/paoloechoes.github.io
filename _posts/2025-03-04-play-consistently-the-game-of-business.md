# Play Consistently the Game of Business

Business is game.

Like any game to win, you must put in the hours.

## The Game-like Business Approach

In order to succeed in business, you must enjoy what you're doing even if there are tasks you’d rather not complete or days you feel like giving up.

Much like playing a video game, where your goal is to level up, business operates on similar principles.

Here’s why:

- **Leveling Up:** In video games, you start with easy challenges, leveling up before tackling the harder ones.
- **Skill Matching:** You don’t enter a level-100 dungeon as a level-1 player.

Likewise, in business:

- Start with challenges that match your current skill level.
- Build your skills step by step.
- Avoid overwhelming yourself with tasks beyond your current capabilities, or you may end up quitting.

**Actionable Takeaway:** Consistent progress is key—start small, level up, and take on harder tasks as your skills improve.

## Don't Identify Too Deeply With Your Business

**Remember this:** _You are not the business you run._

Why is this important?

- If you over-identify with your business, you risk losing hope when things don’t go as planned.
- True entrepreneurs apply a broad set of skills to a business model, making it work efficiently to generate profit.
- Your identity is not tied to one business—it's tied to your ability to run any business.

**Think About It This Way:**

- Running a bookstore doesn’t make you a librarian.
- Owning a gym doesn’t make you a personal trainer.

Instead, you're an entrepreneur capable of scaling **any** business when you develop key skills like marketing and sales.

**Actionable Takeaway:** To win long-term, distance your personal identity from the business you run, and focus on applying universal entrepreneurial skills.

## Scaling Requires Learning New Skills

Many entrepreneurs fail to succeed because they refuse to learn critical skills like marketing and sales.

**The Reality:**

- Marketing and sales are not just for “sketchy salesmen.”
- They are the essential tools to scale and grow any business.

**Actionable Takeaway:** Don’t shy away from the skills that make you uncomfortable. Learn them, apply them, and watch your business grow.

## The Final Level: Keep Playing the Game

Business is a long-term game. Whether you’re facing setbacks or enjoying a streak of success, the key is to keep playing. You don’t win by quitting when it gets hard—you win by leveling up, adapting, and always learning.

**Here’s Your Mission:**

- Start with manageable challenges.
- Develop a broad set of entrepreneurial skills.
- Always remember—you are not defined by any single business; you are defined by your ability to run **any** business.

The real winners in the game of business aren’t those who start fast. It’s those who keep playing, keep learning, and keep evolving.
